# aDF for WoW 1.12
aDF adds a small HUD that standardizes critical info about your target's defences, including Armor, ~~Resists~~, and specific debuffs. This HUD should be useful to all DPS and Tank players who would play differently depending on the state of their enemy's defenses and vulnerabilities.
